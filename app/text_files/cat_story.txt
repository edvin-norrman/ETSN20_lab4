Curious cat starts work. First job
ever today. Office smells like data.
Spreadsheets glare at him. He 
sharpens tiny claws. Keyboard fears
his paws. Boss hands analysis task.
Numbers dance before him. He crunches
figures fast. Charts rise and fall.
Team watches in awe. Cat meows with 
pride. Insights flow like cream.
Graphs gain fuzzy charm. Manager nods
impressed. Cat earns promotion quickly.
Tail flicks confidently now. Analyst cat
conquers stats. Workplace becomes his
playground. Everyone trusts cat now.
